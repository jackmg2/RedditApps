# El Commentator: Quick Comment Templates

## ⚠️ Migration Notice
Updating from an older version? Backup your comment templates first! The new version uses a different storage system and won't automatically migrate old data.

## ⚡️ What It Does
Never type the same moderation comment twice! El Commentator helps you post predefined comment templates instantly, whether manually or automatically based on post flairs.

* Quick comment templates 💬
* Auto-comment on flairs 🏷️
* Auto-comment for specific users 👽
* Multiple comments per user (randomly selected) 🎲
* Pin comments automatically 📌
* Priority-based selection 🎯
* Markdown support ✨

## 🎮 How it works?
### Create your templates based on flair (or just on all posts)
* From your subreddit, click the three dots next to mod tools
* Hit "El Commentator: Create Comment Template"
* Write your template with title and content
* Choose target flairs or set to display on all posts
* Check "Sticky comment" if needed

### Create your templates for users
* From your subreddit, click the three dots next to mod tools
* Hit "El Commentator: Create User Comment Template"
* Write your template with title and content
* Write username
* Check "Sticky comment" if needed
* **Note**: You can create multiple different comment templates for the same user - one will be randomly selected when triggered

### Manual posting
* Click mod tools under any post
* Hit "El Commentator: Post Predefined Comment"
* Choose your template
* Check "Sticky comment" if needed

### Automatic posting
* Enable auto-commenting in app settings
* Comments post automatically when flaired posts are created
* Priority system ensures the most relevant comment is selected
* For users with multiple comment templates, one is randomly chosen

## ⚙️ Settings to be even faster
* Enable auto-commenting on flaired posts
* Set default pin behavior
* Manage all templates from one place

## 🎯 Priority System
If two comments should be displayed and one is a comment for a user, they are going to be merged.

When multiple templates match a post, only one comment is posted based on priority:
1. **Highest**: Templates with exactly 1 matching flair
2. **Medium**: Templates with multiple flairs including the post's flair
3. **Lowest**: Templates set to "Display on all posts"

**User-based comments**: If multiple comment templates exist for the same user, one is randomly selected each time they post.
