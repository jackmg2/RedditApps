# Ban extended: Ban user and remove all of their content.

## July update
* The application can remove NSFW content again!

## ⚡️ What It Does

We all have to manage some flood campaign. It can be tedious to remove each comment by ourselves. This extension is there to help you nuke an user and all of his content!

## 🎮 How it works?
### Ban & Remove
* Click mod tools
* Hit "Ban User and Remove Content"
* Fill the ban form as usual
* Choose if you want to remove all content or just the previous days
* BAM!

### Export banned list
* From the community menu settings
* Click on "Ban Extended: Export Banned Users"
* And copy the list of your banned users

### Bulk ban
* From the community menu settings
* Click on "Ban Extended: Bulk Ban Users"
* And past the list of your banned users

Great to synchronize ban users between communities!
