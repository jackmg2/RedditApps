# Ban extended: Ban user and remove all of their content.

## ⚡️ What It Does

We all have to manage some flood campaign. It can be tedious to remove each comment by ourselves. This extension is there to help you nuke an user and all of his content!

## 🎮 How it works?

* Click mod tools
* Hit "Ban User and Remove Content"
* Fill the ban form as usual
* Choose if you want to remove all content or just the previous days
* BAM!
