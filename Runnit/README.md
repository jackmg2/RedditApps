## What is Runnit?

Runnit is a fun, retro-style running game that brings the excitement of track and field to your subreddit! Control a cartoon sprinter on a professional athletics track and see how fast you can complete 100 meters. But be careful - one wrong step and you'll trip and fall!

## 🎮 How to Play

### The Goal
Run 100 meters as fast as possible by alternating your left and right leg steps. Your time will be recorded and you'll compete against everyone else in your subreddit for the fastest time!

### Controls
- **On Desktop**: Left mouse click = Left leg step, Right mouse click = Right leg step
- **On Mobile**: Tap the left side of screen = Left leg, Tap the right side = Right leg

### The Challenge
Here's the catch that makes it exciting: **You must alternate between left and right legs!** 

✅ **Correct**: Left → Right → Left → Right → Left...  
❌ **Wrong**: Left → Left (You'll trip and fall!)

### Winning Strategy
1. **Keep a steady rhythm** - Find your pace and stick to it
2. **Stay focused** - It's easy to accidentally double-tap the same side
3. **Practice makes perfect** - Your first few attempts might end in spectacular falls!
