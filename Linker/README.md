Create a post to pin links and pictures.
Useful to gather all information about your community or set-up a shop preview!

## How does it work?
From your community homepage, click on the three dots next to your mod tools and then "Create Links Board".

You can customize the name of your post.
You can create as many as you want.

Don't forget to refresh after creation, it can take a little time to appear.

As a moderator, you can modify the subtitle of your grid and customize each cell of the grid. If you click on an item, you won't be able to navigate but you will be able to modify it.

Your users will be able to navigate to the link by clicking on the item.
