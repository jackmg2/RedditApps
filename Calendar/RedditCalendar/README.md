# Aye Aye Calendar! 
The best calendar to display upcoming events in your community!

## How does it work?
From your community homepage, click on the three dots next to your mod tools and then "Create Community Calendar".

The calendar experiment post is going to be loaded, and as a moderator, you are going to be able to add events.

You can set a Title, a description, a begin and end date and choose your favorite colors for the font and the background (Hexadecimal only, you know like #FF00FF).
You can even put a link under it!

Events are going to be grouped in three categories:
* Today's event
* Events happening this month
* And future events

You can modify these labels in the app settings! We know not all communities are speaking English.

When your events have been created, you can modify or remove them by clicking on the corresponding buttons.

## Known issues
* Please refresh the page each time you add an event
* Description text may not wrap, you can use line returns
* If you have a link on your event and you want to edit, a modal window is going to ask you if you want to navigate to the website. Click no.
