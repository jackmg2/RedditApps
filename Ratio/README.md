# Ratio-bobo

Ratio-bobo is a bot to balance posts from your users.

In the App settings, you can define the number of posts allowed that are not a post with a specific flair.

For example, you have an open-source project, you want to motivate people to create Documentation posts.

In Settings, you can set the `Ratio` value at 2 and the `Tracked post flair` on "Documentation".

That means that your users will need to write a Documentation post for each 2 questions posts they will create.
