# Ratio! Bobobo! Motivate your users to contribute on some specific flair.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è What It Does

Ratio-bobo is a bot to balance posts from your users.

In the App settings, you can define the number of posts allowed that are not a post with a specific flair.

For example, you have an open-source project, you want to motivate people to create Documentation posts.

In Settings, you can set the `Ratio` value at 2 and the `Tracked post flair` on "Documentation".

That means that your users will need to write a Documentation post for each 2 questions posts they will create.

## üéÆ How it works?
Most of the work is done automatically! ü§ñ

You can do several quick actions from community menu:
* Manually set user ratio: You can fix the ratio manually for the current user
* Refresh Wiki: Manually update the wiki page with the latest ratio records

Or directly from a post:
* Change flair and update ratio: If the user picked up the wrong flair, you can change it. The ratio will be updated automatically.
* Remove flair: Quickly remove a post's flair and update the user's ratio in one click
* Set User Ratio by Username: Set the ratio for any user by entering their username

## üßÆ Automatic Ratio Management
The app automatically manages ratios for common actions:
* When a user submits a post that violates the ratio, it's removed WITHOUT affecting their ratio
* When a user deletes their own post, their ratio is automatically adjusted
* All changes to ratios are recorded in a wiki page for transparency

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings to be even faster
* Set the expected ratio: x posts for each tracked flair
* Set the flairs you want to track. You can separate them with semicolons, for example: "Documentation;Fix"
* Comment for ratio violation to explain why a post has been removed
* Comment for wrong flair, to explain that it was not the expected flair

## üÜï Last update
* Posts removed due to ratio violations no longer affect the user's ratio
* User ratio is automatically updated when they delete their posts
* New subreddit menu item to set any user's ratio by username
* You can now remove and update a flair in one click!

## Next update
* [ ] Fix order in wiki page (order by date and time)
* [ ] Fix error toast message that shouldn't be displayed (it's working)
