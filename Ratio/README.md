# Ratio! Bobobo! Motivate your users to contribute on some specific flair.

## ⚡️ What It Does

Ratio-bobo is a bot to balance posts from your users.

In the App settings, you can define the number of posts allowed that are not a post with a specific flair.

For example, you have an open-source project, you want to motivate people to create Documentation posts.

In Settings, you can set the `Ratio` value at 2 and the `Tracked post flair` on "Documentation".

That means that your users will need to write a Documentation post for each 2 questions posts they will create.

## 🎮 How it works?
Most of the work is done automatically! 🤖

You can do two quick actions from mod tools:
* Manually set user ratio: You can fix the ratio manually
* Change flair and update ratio: If the user picked up the wrong flair, you can change it. The ratio will be updated automatically.

## ⚙️ Settings to be even faster
* Set the expected ratio: x posts for each tracked flair
* Set the flairs you want to track. You can separate them with semicolons, for example: "Documentation;Fix"
* Comment for ratio violation to explain why a post has been removed
* Comment for wrong flair, to explain that it was not the expected flair

## 🆕 Last update
* You can now remove and update a flair in one click!
