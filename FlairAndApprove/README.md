5. **Hit submit** - Everything happens automatically!

### Bulk Approval

3. **Select the flair** to apply to everyone
4. **Process all** - Watch the magic happen!

### Export Your Users

2. **Copy the list** (formatted as user1;user2;user3)
3. **Use anywhere** - Import to another sub or keep as backup

- Content approved (if selected) 📝
- Mod note created for tracking 📋

**What you control:**
- Which actions to perform (all optional)

- The app continues processing valid users

**Welcome message not posting**
- Check if the comment field is empty
