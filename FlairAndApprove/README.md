2. **Click mod tools** → "Approve & Flair: Verify and approve"
3. **Choose their flair** from your templates
4. **Check what to approve** (user, post/comment, or both)
5. **Hit submit** - Everything happens automatically!

### Bulk Approval
1. **From subreddit menu** → "Approve & Flair: Bulk Approve & Flair Users"
2. **Paste usernames** separated by semi-colons (user1;user2;user3)
3. **Select the flair** to apply to everyone
4. **Process all** - Watch the magic happen!

### Export Your Users
1. **From subreddit menu** → "Approve & Flair: Export Approved Users"
2. **Copy the list** (formatted as user1;user2;user3)
3. **Use anywhere** - Import to another sub or keep as backup

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Setting Up Flairs

- Shadowbanned or deleted users will fail
- The app continues processing valid users
- Try to reduce the list to 25 items and wait for some minutes before each import
